        <h2>Ancient Origins</h2>
        Karachi's history dates back to ancient times. The area has been
        inhabited by various civilizations, including the Indus Valley
        Civilization, which existed around 2500 BCE.
        <h3>Arab and Persian Influence</h3>
        In the 7th century CE, the region came under Arab and later Persian
        influence, becoming an important trading and port city along the Indian
        Ocean trade routes.
        <h4>Colonial Era</h4>
        In the 19th century, Karachi became a part of British India and a
        prominent port city due to its strategic location on the Arabian Sea.
        <h5>Partition and Independence</h5>
        In 1947, Karachi became the capital of Pakistan following the partition
        of India. It played a crucial role in the early years of the newly
        formed nation.
        <h6>Economic Center</h6>
        Karachi has long been the economic center of Pakistan, housing key
        industries, including manufacturing, finance, and commerce.
