        <h2>Infrastructure and Urban Planning</h2>
        Inadequate infrastructure, including roads, public transportation, and
        sewage systems, has led to traffic congestion, flooding during monsoons,
        and other urban planning challenges.
        <h3>Water Shortage</h3>
        Karachi often experiences water shortages, and access to clean drinking
        water is a pressing issue for many residents.
        <h4>Education</h4>
        Despite some progress, access to quality education remains a challenge
        for many residents, especially in low-income areas.
        <h5>Political Instability</h5>
        Political instability and governance issues have sometimes hindered
        effective policymaking and urban management.
        <h6>Security And Crimes</h6>
        Karachi has experienced periods of high crime rates and political
        violence. While security has improved in recent years, crime remains a
        concern in certain areas.
